<HR><h1><a name=up>IMPACT OF GLOBAL</a> WARMING</H1><HR><BR><BR><BR><BIG>
Global warming is already having significant andcostly effects on our communities, our health,and our climate.<BR><BR>

Unless we take immediate action to reduce global warming emissions, these impacts will continue
 to intensify, grow ever more costly and damaging, and increasingly affect the entire planet — including you, your community, and your family.</BIG><BR>

Average global sea level has increased eight inches since 1880, but is rising much faster on the U.S. East Coast and Gulf of Mexico. Global warming is now accelerating the rate of sea level rise, increasing flooding risks to low-lying communities and high-risk coastal properties whose development has been encouraged by today's flood insurance system.</BIG><BR><BR>
<HR><H1>Longer and more damaging wildfire seasons</H1><HR><IMG SRC="images (3).JPG" HEIGHT="50%"
WIDTH="90%"><BR><BIG>Wildfires are increasing and wildfire season is getting longer in the Western U.S. as temperatures rise. Higher spring and summer temperatures and earlier spring snow-melt result in forests that are hotter and drier for longer periods of time, priming conditions for wildfires to ignite and spread.</BIG><BR><BR>
<HR><H1>More destructive hurricanes</H1><HR><BR><IMG SRC="gw-impacts-hurricane-ike-damage-gilchrist-tx.JPG" HEIGHT="50%" WIDTH="90%"
<BIG>While hurricanes are a natural part of our climate system, recent research indicates that their destructive power, or intensity, has been growing since the 1970s, particularly in the North Atlantic region.</BIG><BR><HR><H1>More frequent and intense heat waves</H1><HR><IMG SRC="gw-impacts-heat-jogger-sweating.JPG"
HEIGHT="50%" WIDTH="90%"><BIG>Dangerously hot weather is already occuring more frequently than it did 60 years ago—and scientists expect heat waves to become more frequent and severe as global warming intensifies. This increase in heat waves creates serious health risks, and can lead to heat exhaustion, heat stroke, and aggravate existing medical conditions.</BIG><br>
